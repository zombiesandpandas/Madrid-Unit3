<body bgcolor="#ccffff"
 <p> For those who do not know what bioshock is, it is actually a first - person shooter video 

game.While exploring the underwater dystopia, Rapture, the player is urged to turn everything 

into a weapon: biologically modifying their own body with Plasmids, hacking devices and systems, 

upgrading their weapons, crafting new ammo variants, and experimenting with different battle 

techniques are all possible. The philosophy, architecture, and society of Rapture were strongly 

inspired by the works of Andrew ryan, especially the novel Atlas Shrugged. - wikileaks bio of bioshock </p>
<font face="harrington" color="grey">"A man has a choice, I chose the impossible. I built a city 

where the artists would not fear the censor, where the great would not be constrained by the 

small, where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality. I chose to build Rapture. But 

my city was betrayed by the weak. So I ask you my friend, if your life were the prize, would you 

kill the innocent? Would you sacrifice your humanity?"
-Andrew Ryan</font>

<h3> Why everyone loves bioshock</h3>
<p> Bioshock may seem like your ordinary game, where you kill enemies with weapons and your goal is to resque whomever. The uniqueness about BioShock is that the game is based about a underwater city that went totally downhill because of abuse of the plasmids and ADAM. The people became splicers, total crazy splicers.You are trying to stop all of this, you are trying to get out, and you are on an adventure, where you yourself will have to use plasmids and ADAM to fight off the splicers. As you go along the way you eventually meet these little girks who have deep glowing eyes. These girls are the little sisters, they were kidnapped when rapture was at its best, they trained the little ones to be collectors of adam. You get the option to kill or save them, but if you get to close to these little sisters, their "big daddy" will attack. This game makes you question every single thing you do, this game makes you do things that will change your outcome. Based on the desicions you make, the game can end in 2 different ways.</p>
