<h4> Why everyone loves BioShock Infinite</h4>
Everyone loves Infinite because of the plot twist and the story behind it. In order for you to understand this you need to pay close attentionand understand ultranationalism, religious fanaticism, and social Darwinism. The game requires you to know and understand these things, i cannot explain the outcomes because i do not want to spoil things.
